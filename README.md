A simple React application that grabs data on articles from a specific API, then displays that information in a user friendly manner.

To test it, make sure you have Node.js installed, then clone the repository and cd into it, then run ```npm install``` and ```npm build```.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
